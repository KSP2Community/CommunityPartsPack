# Images Folder Organization
This folder helps you organize the reference and inspirational images associated with the parts in your parts pack. You don't have to do things this way, but it may help you keep things organized as you add more parts.
* **Create** part category folders here (e.g., `Engines`, `Fuel Tanks`, etc.)
* **OPTIONAL: Create** part-specific folders located in the appropriate category (e.g. `.\Engines\cpp_VIKAS_1v`, etc.), where the part folder name should be the same as the part name you plan to use. This is not *required*, but it will help you to keep things organized.
* **Put** any reference or inspirational images you like in appropriate folders.
